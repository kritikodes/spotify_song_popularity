# 🎵 Spotify Song Popularity Prediction

📊 Predict the popularity of a song based on its features using machine learning.

## 📌 Project Overview
This project aims to predict the popularity of a song using various song attributes available in a Kaggle dataset. The dataset includes features such as danceability, energy, loudness, tempo, and more to determine a song's popularity score.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python**: Core programming language
- **Pandas**: Data processing and manipulation
- **NumPy**: Numerical computations
- **Scikit-Learn**: Machine learning model training
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Data visualization

## 📂 Dataset
- Source: [Kaggle - Spotify Song Data](https://www.kaggle.com/)
- Includes features such as:
  - Acousticness
  - Danceability
  - Energy
  - Instrumentalness
  - Liveness
  - Loudness
  - Speechiness
  - Tempo
  - Valence
  - Duration
  - Popularity (target variable)

## 🚀 Installation & Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/spotify-song-popularity.git
   cd spotify-song-popularity
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
   ```
3. Download the dataset from Kaggle and place it in the project directory.
4. Run the model training script:
   ```sh
   python main.py
   ```

## 📊 Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning, handling missing values, and feature scaling.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understanding relationships between song attributes and popularity.
3. **Model Training**: Using regression models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, etc.) to predict popularity.
4. **Evaluation**: Assessing model performance using metrics like RMSE and R².
